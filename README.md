# Lab 1: HTML and CSS Landing Page

## What I did
In this lab, I created a simple landing page using **HTML** and then added styles with **CSS**.  
At first, I only wrote the structure (navigation, header, content, footer).  
Later, I added colors, layout with Flexbox/Grid, and made the page look better.  
I also tested the page in the browser and took two screenshots:  
1. HTML only version (no style)  
2. Final styled version  

## What worked well
The structure was easy to build, and CSS made the page look modern.  
Using GitHub to push and save my work was also smooth.  

## What was difficult
It was a little hard to match the design and to choose good colors.  
I also had to check carefully how to use Flexbox and media queries.  

## Notes
I learned how important it is to separate structure (HTML) and design (CSS).  
This lab helped me practice real steps for web development.
